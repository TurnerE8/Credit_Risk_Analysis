# Credit_Risk_Analysis

##Overview 

The purpose of this analysis was to develop six models to decide which model is best at predicting which loans pose the highest risk. 

##Results 

1. Naive Random Oversampling: accuracy was 65%, precision was 99%, recall was 61% 
2. SMOTE: accuracy was 62%, precision was 99%, recall was 64% 
3. Undersampling: accuracy was 52%, precision was 99%, recall was 45% 
4. Combination: accuracy was 64%, precision was 99%, recall was 58% 
5. Balanced Random Forest: accuracy was 78%, precision was 99%, recall was 91%
6. Easy Ensemble Adaboost: accuracy was 92%, precision was 99%, recall was 94% 

##Summary 

It is evident that Easy Ensemable Adaboost is the best model to use because of its balance of its accuracy, precision and recall scores.
